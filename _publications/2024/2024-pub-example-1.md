abstract: >-
  We proposed a novel weakly-supervised framework, Geometry-Aware Transformer (GOAT), in which we urge the model to pay attention to the geometric characteristics within the tumor microenvironment which often serve as potent indicators. In addition, a context-aware attention mechanism is designed to extract and enhance the morphological features within WSIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of consistently reaching superior classification outcomes for gigapixel whole slide images.
