  In this paper, we present an innovative weakly-supervised sequence feature optimization method to solve the problem of sub-optimal feature extraction by the foundation model in the traditional MIL paradigm. The proposed SeqFRT leverages a sequence position optimization strategy to exploit the inherent valuable information embedded within the long pathological feature sequences and a sequence sparsity enhancement technique to highly enhance the ability to discriminate and extract the latent representations instead of redundant information, leading to preserving essential information for reconstructing input pathological sequence representation which is crucial for downstream tasks in computational pathology. The experimen�tal results on six benchmark datasets showcase the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring its potential to significantly enhance computational pathology.
