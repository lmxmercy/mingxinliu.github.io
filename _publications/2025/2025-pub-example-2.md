abstract: >-
  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is challenging to diagnose accurately from pathological images due to its complex histological features. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model, IBDAIM, to assist pathologists in quickly and accurately diagnosing IBD by analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) of intestinal biopsies.
