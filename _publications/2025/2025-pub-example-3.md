   This work proposes a novel MIL framework: Dynamic Graph and State Space Model-Based MIL (DG-SSM-MIL). DG-SSM-MIL combines graph neural networks and selective state space models, leveraging the former’s ability to extract local and spatial features and the latter’s advantage in comprehensively understanding long-sequence instances. This enhances the model’s performance in diverse instance classification, improves its capability to handle long-sequence data, and increases the precision and scalability of feature fusion. We propose the Dynamic Graph and State Space Model (DynGraph-SSM) module, which aggregates local and spatial information of image patches through directed graphs and learns global feature representations using the Mamba model.
