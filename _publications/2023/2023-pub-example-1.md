  We propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets consistently emphasize that MGCT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
